Required:
 # [http://maven.apache.org/ Maven installed]
 # Eclipse [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/heliossr2 Helios] or [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/indigosr1 Indigo]
 # [http://eclipse.org/m2e/ The Sonatype maven plugin for Eclipse]

First check out the multiplicity project from the branch.

Go to http://tel.dur.ac.uk/artifactory/webapp/mavensettings.html and generate the settings.xml file which you'll need to put in ~/.m2/

Check out multiplicity3-parent into eclipse as a general (non-Java) project.  In eclipse go to file > import and select maven > Existing Maven Projects.  Ensure all the projects contained in multiplicity3-parent are selected and click finish.  


*To Create a Jar Deployment*

Ensure that any src/main/resources or src/test/resources folders on a projectâ€™s classpath do not have entries in their excluded fields. Right click the project and select Export > Java > Runnable jar file.
