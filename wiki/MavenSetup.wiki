*Basic Project Setup*

You'll need:
1. Maven installed
2. Eclipse Helios
3. Sonatype maven plugin for Eclipse
4. Subversion plugin for Eclipse

If working outside the Durham University network you will need to tunnel with a command similar to this:

ssh -L 8081:tel.dur.ac.uk:8081 username@vega.dur.ac.uk

Go to http://tel.dur.ac.uk:8081/artifactory/webapp/mavensettings.html and generate the settings.xml file which you'll need to put in ~/.m2/

If working outside the Durham University network add the following to your settings.xml in ~/.m2/ before `<profiles>` (and remember to remove it when working within the University network):

{{{
  <proxies>
   <proxy>
      <active>true</active>
      <protocol>http</protocol>
      <host>127.0.0.1</host>
      <port>8081</port>
      <username></username>
      <password></password>
      <nonProxyHosts></nonProxyHosts>
    </proxy>
  </proxies>
}}}

Check out multiplicity3-parent into eclipse as a general (non-Java) project.  In eclipse go to file > import and select maven > Existing Maven Projects.  Ensure all the projects contained in multiplicity3-parent are selected and click finish.  


*To Create a Jar Desployment*

Ensure that any src/main/resources or src/test/resources folders on a projectâ€™s classpath do not have entries in their excluded fields. Right click the project and select Export > Java > Runnable jar file.
