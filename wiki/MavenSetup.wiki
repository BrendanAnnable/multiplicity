Basic Project Setup

You'll need:
1. Maven installed
2. Eclipse Helios
3. Sonatype maven plugin for Eclipse
4. Subversion plugin for Eclipse

If working outside the Durham University network you will need to tunnel with a command similar to this:

ssh -L 8081:tel.dur.ac.uk:8081 username@vega.dur.ac.uk

Go to http://tel.dur.ac.uk:8081/artifactory/webapp/mavensettings.html and generate the settings.xml file which you'll need to put in ~/.m2/

If working outside the Durham University network add the following to your settings.xml in ~/.m2/ before `<profiles>` (and remember to remove it when working within the University network):
<code language="xml">
  <proxies>
   <proxy>
      <active>true</active>
      <protocol>http</protocol>
      <host>127.0.0.1</host>
      <port>8081</port>
      <username></username>
      <password></password>
      <nonProxyHosts></nonProxyHosts>
    </proxy>
  </proxies>`
